Jai Sachdev is a computational physicist at the [Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory](https://www.pppl.gov) in the Multiscale Integrated Modeling Group of the [Computational Sciences Department](https://cs.pppl.gov). His research interests include:
- Multiscale integrated modeling in plasma physics and fluid dynamics,
- Methods for mesh adaptation, including grid refinement and embedded boundaries,
- Modeling of multi-phase fluids, gas-solid flows in particular,
- High performance scientific computing, and
- Best practices for scientific computing.

At Princeton he is one of the developers of the [TRANSP](https://transp.pppl.gov). This code is used by scientists worldwide to study magnetically confined fusion devices. He previously worked as a research engineer at an aerospace consulting firm, [Combustion Research and Flow Technology](https://www.craft-tech.com), where he was one of the primary developers of the CRUNCH CFD code. Jai obtained his undergraduate degree from the [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca) program at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), and did his graduate studies at the [University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies](https://utias.utoronto.ca).
