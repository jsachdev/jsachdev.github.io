## TRANSP

[TRANSP](https://transp.pppl.gov/) is a time-dependent 1.5D MHD equilibrium and plasma transport solver for modeling tokamak fusion devices. This software is used by hundreds of scientists at several research centers world-wide for interpreting experimental results, predictive analysis, experimental campaign planning, and rapid between shot analysis. The capabilities of the code has grown significantly over 30+ years of development, particularly with respect to the physics models. Extending the physics capabilties is stil being pursued but in coordination with a major overhauling of the codebase.

## Pellet ablation models

Implementation, testing, and application of pellet ablation models using TRANSP and PELLET (a pellet ablation code from ORNL/GA). Injection of pellets and shattered pellets are being studied as possible mechanisms for fueling of magnetic fusion devices as well as for control of disruptions and instabilities.
